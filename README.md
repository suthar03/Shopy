# Shopy
IT IS A SHOP MANAGEMENT DESKTOP APPLICATION.

Developed a customized application for shop management.
Motivation behind this application is to create an 
application which is very easy to use and understandable.
 As many shopkeepers in rural areas are not much educated, 
 so I have created this application for all such peoples. 
 I have created this application on demand of my brother. 
 He is running a shop in our village. Like we have to do lots 
 of calculation while making balance sheet/Bills for customers. 
 And we have to do I repeatedly like for every customer we have 
 to do at least twice in a month. It takes almost 2 days 
 (working 15-20 hours) only for calculation and cross checking. 
 He motivated me to do this, As sometime whenever I was at 
 home I also have to help in that process. To reduce the effort,
  I have done this. This application successfully running from 
  01 January 2020 to onward. I have done trial for 2 months by 
  myself to figure out bugs. And then I handover this application
   to my brother and I am working on it to improve some algorithms.

## Implimentation

 I have implemented this application with swing GUI in Java 
 frame work using java programming language. This is available 
 for both English and Hindi language. I have spent little more 
 then the expected as that time I was new to java and this is 
 first ever project. So, the code is also kind of bulky but now
  I am working on it to get rid of it again and use efficient 
  algorithms to optimize it. I converting file system database 
  to SQL database. I think I want you take you through my new 
  approach first and then if we have time then we will go for 
  the existing codes.
